- This is a simple dice game between two players
- each player has a total score and a current score both starting at zero
- first player to hit the set goal score of 30 wins
- the idea is that players roll the dice to increment their current score to maximum before they decide to HOLD that current score
- when player holds, the current score is added to their total score, and game switches to other player
- but if either player rolls a 1, score is NOT held and player switches
- clicking the NEW GAME button resets the game, all scores to 0
